== Coding guidelines ==

* Be sensible
* Be tolerant

== Whitespace ==

* Use space, not tabs. You can only get away with tabs if your name is Richard Fairhurst
* Set your editor to treat tabs as four spaces when viewing them, otherwise you'll go mad
* Blank lines shouldn't have whitespace
* No trailing whitespace
* Only "fix" whitespace errors while changing that line of code for other reasons. Otherwise, it's not worth fixing.

== Indentation ==

package net.systemed.potlatch2.indentation {

    class IndentedByFourSpaces {

        public function IndentedByFourMoreSpaces():void {
            if (indentedCodeWithinFunctionHasTwoSpaceIndents) {
              // lots of places in the codebase have two-space indents within functions
              // like this. Don't mix and match like this example!
              beConsistent = true;
            } else {
                useFourSpaceIndents = true;
            }
        }
    }
}

== MXML ==

* Indentation is like the wild west in there. Consistency is king.
