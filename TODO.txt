Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
-----------------------------------

== Code tidying ==

* A fair amount of the mouse-handling in each ControllerState is shared with others - 
  and some probably should be (e.g. unhovering). Can we refactor?


== Core geometry ==

* Undo/redo
* Reverse way direction
* Deleting a way with junction nodes doesn't redraw them


== Vector background layers ==

* Remove existing interaction and add alt-click
* Import from GPX
* Import from OSM (is this worth sharing with the XML API stuff?)


== Other core ==

* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support


== UI ==

* Keyboard shortcuts
* CSS editing
* Direct click-to-edit of relation role should actually work
* Toolbox fixes (see comments in file)
* Dynamic reloading of stylesheet/map_features, so that you don't need to reload the full page when editing them
* If a select name is too long then, the select menu seems to give a horizontal scrollbar instead of the name of the item e.g. cuisine#Coffee Shop
* If you have both inputSets names and buildingAddress, and name= key is filled in then the basic tab will get both, surely only name should be shown and building name should be ignored e.g. cafes. [Actually this was an issue of addr: being missing from one of them, however this may still be a problem for other overlapping inputSets]


== Tagging ==


== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* Shields
* Complete MapCSS support
* Would be useful to be able to 'suspend' redrawing
* 'Light' version without vectorlayer support etc.
