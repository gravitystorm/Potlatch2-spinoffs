Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
-----------------------------------

== Core geometry ==

* Bit more work required on relations when splitting ways
* Make parallelise properly undoable


== Vector background layers ==

* TagTransform (cf http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/TagTransform)
* Import from OSM (is this worth sharing with the XML API stuff?)


== Other core ==

* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support


== Tag editing ==

* Doesn't always update selected tab when you select a new entity
* 'Add to route' in relations doesn't work
* Direct click-to-edit of relation role should actually work
* Dynamic reloading of stylesheet/map_features, so that you don't need to reload the full page when editing them
* If a select name is too long then, the select menu seems to give a horizontal scrollbar instead of the name of the item e.g. cuisine#Coffee Shop
* If you have both inputSets names and buildingAddress, and name= key is filled in then the basic tab will get both, surely only name should be shown and building name should be ignored e.g. cafes. [Actually this was an issue of addr: being missing from one of them, however this may still be a problem for other overlapping inputSets]
* It would be useful to have fields that only allow numbers in a non-destructive way, for example for step_count or capacity.
* The area of pois for dragging on to the map should have a search, with synonyms and also be categorised like the lines are.
* Bug where the wrong feature is used, when an item that is dragged from the list when an POI has no icon.
* Checkboxes, for example what you can recycle, or whether something is a bridge or tunnel
* Ability to specify that a node should be a point in a way, for example for crossings
* Ability to say that it's unlikely/impossible to have a way that is a bridge and a tunnel at the same time.


== UI ==

* Potlatch 1-style "floaty warnings"
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Mouse wheel zooming
* CSS editing
* Toolbox fixes (see comments in file)
* Quick-search on add-relations-to-way dialog (RelationSelectPanel)
* Bug: when drawing way, escape ends drawing. Should revert to previous way.
* Mouse icon should indicate when a join is being made (blue nodes might not be visible)
* Bug: when joining way to existing, a blue node is shown until mouse moves
* Yahoo! layer can't handle z18+, (Bug:) and continues to show z17 when zoomed in



== Miscellaneous data model ==

* Remove created_by=* tags from any data touched


== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* Changing style, and then back again, doesn't redraw everything
* Shields
* More line decoration (cliffs etc.), and implied values for 'dashes' if not supplied
* Complete MapCSS support
* Don't redraw stuff that's offscreen
* 'Light' version without vectorlayer support etc.
* Infinite z-indexes
