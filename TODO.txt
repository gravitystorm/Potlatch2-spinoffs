Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
-----------------------------------

== Code tidying ==

* A fair amount of the mouse-handling in each ControllerState is shared with others - 
  and some probably should be (e.g. unhovering). Can we refactor?


== Core geometry ==

* Delete POIs and ways
* Merge ways (almost there)
* Undo/redo
* Reverse way direction


== Other core ==

* GPS tracks
* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support


== UI ==

* UI for geometry operations
* Keyboard shortcuts
* CSS editing
* Direct click-to-edit of relation role should actually work


== Tagging ==


== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* Shields
* Complete MapCSS support
* Would be useful to be able to 'suspend' redrawing
