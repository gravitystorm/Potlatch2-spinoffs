Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
-----------------------------------

== Code tidying ==

* A fair amount of the mouse-handling in each ControllerState is shared with others - 
  and some probably should be (e.g. unhovering). Can we refactor?


== Core geometry ==

* Undo/redo
* Reverse way direction


== Vector background layers ==

* Remove existing interaction and add alt-click
* Import from GPX
* Import from OSM (is this worth sharing with the XML API stuff?)


== Other core ==

* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support


== UI ==

* UI for geometry operations
* Keyboard shortcuts
* CSS editing
* Direct click-to-edit of relation role should actually work
* Dynamic reloading of stylesheet/map_features, so that you don't need to reload the full page when editing them


== Tagging ==


== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* Shields
* Complete MapCSS support
* Would be useful to be able to 'suspend' redrawing
* 'Light' version without vectorlayer support etc.
