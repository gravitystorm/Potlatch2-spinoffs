Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
-----------------------------------
** = required before P2 goes live

== Core geometry ==

** Straighten way + undo + redo looks fine in the UI, but doesn't reinsert the nodes into the way properly when saving (maybe way isn't dirty?)
* Dragging multipolygons (or constituent nodes) doesn't force redraw of all ways - need to hook something up to WAY_NODE_MOVED
* Make parallelise properly undoable
* Make Quadralatalawhatsit properly undoable
* Splitway + undo leaves way marked dirty

== Vector background layers ==

* TagTransform (cf http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/TagTransform)
* Import from OSM (is this worth sharing with the XML API stuff?)
* Load GPX from API

== Other core ==

* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support

== Saving ==

* Save should be deactivated until there's things to change
* Should be able to reuse changesets
* Shouldn't be able to change created_by and version on changeset

== Tag editing ==

** Doesn't always update selected tab when you select a new entity
** Doesn't update selected tab when you change the relations on an entity
* Dynamic reloading of stylesheet/map_features, so that you don't need to reload the full page when editing them
* If a select name is too long then, the select menu seems to give a horizontal scrollbar instead of the name of the item e.g. cuisine#Coffee Shop
* If you have both inputSets names and buildingAddress, and name= key is filled in then the basic tab will get both, surely only name should be shown and building name should be ignored e.g. cafes. [Actually this was an issue of addr: being missing from one of them, however this may still be a problem for other overlapping inputSets]
* It would be useful to have fields that only allow numbers in a non-destructive way, for example for step_count or capacity.
* The area of pois for dragging on to the map should have a search, with synonyms and also be categorised like the lines are.
* Bug where the wrong feature is used, when an item that is dragged from the list when an POI has no icon.
* Checkboxes, for example what you can recycle, or whether something is a bridge or tunnel
* Ability to specify that a node should be a point in a way, for example for crossings
* Ability to say that it's unlikely/impossible to have a way that is a bridge and a tunnel at the same time.

== UI ==

** Potlatch 1-style "floaty warnings"
** Should remember which background imagery layer you had previously selected
* Custom imagery dialog fixes
* Ctrl-clicking two areas (one inside the other) should create a multipolygon
* B keypress for background source tag
* Bbox-sensitive menu for background imagery
* Mouse wheel zooming
* CSS editing
* Quick-search on add-relations-to-way dialog (RelationSelectPanel)
* Bug: when drawing way, escape ends drawing. Should revert to previous way.
* i18n
* Multiple selection

== Miscellaneous data model ==

* Remove created_by=* tags from any data touched

== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

** Infinite z-indexes
* Shields
* More line decoration (cliffs etc.), and implied values for 'dashes' if not supplied
* Complete MapCSS support
* 'Light' version without vectorlayer support etc.
* .gz support for OSMConnection
* Multipolygon rendering for dashedLine, lineDecoration, and WayBitmapFiller
* Multipolygons should take their tags from the relation, not the way
