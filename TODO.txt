Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
-----------------------------------

== Core geometry ==

* Make parallelise properly undoable
* Make Quadralatalawhatsit properly undoable
* Splitway + undo leaves way marked dirty
* Straighten way + undo + redo looks fine in the UI, but doesn't reinsert the nodes into the way properly when saving (maybe way isn't dirty?)

== Vector background layers ==

* TagTransform (cf http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/TagTransform)
* Import from OSM (is this worth sharing with the XML API stuff?)

== Other core ==

* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support

== Saving ==

* Comment and advanced -> "comment" should show the same thing
* Save should be deactivated until there's things to change
* Should be able to reuse changesets
* Shouldn't be able to change created_by and version on changeset

== Tag editing ==

* Doesn't always update selected tab when you select a new entity
* 'Add to route' in relations doesn't work
* Direct click-to-edit of relation role should actually work
* Dynamic reloading of stylesheet/map_features, so that you don't need to reload the full page when editing them
* If a select name is too long then, the select menu seems to give a horizontal scrollbar instead of the name of the item e.g. cuisine#Coffee Shop
* If you have both inputSets names and buildingAddress, and name= key is filled in then the basic tab will get both, surely only name should be shown and building name should be ignored e.g. cafes. [Actually this was an issue of addr: being missing from one of them, however this may still be a problem for other overlapping inputSets]
* It would be useful to have fields that only allow numbers in a non-destructive way, for example for step_count or capacity.
* The area of pois for dragging on to the map should have a search, with synonyms and also be categorised like the lines are.
* Bug where the wrong feature is used, when an item that is dragged from the list when an POI has no icon.
* Checkboxes, for example what you can recycle, or whether something is a bridge or tunnel
* Ability to specify that a node should be a point in a way, for example for crossings
* Ability to say that it's unlikely/impossible to have a way that is a bridge and a tunnel at the same time.


== UI ==

* Parallelise should use the distance from the way, not from the first click (needs someone good at maths to fix this)
* Potlatch 1-style "floaty warnings"
* Keyboard shortcuts
* Mouse wheel zooming
* CSS editing
* Toolbox fixes (see comments in file)
* Quick-search on add-relations-to-way dialog (RelationSelectPanel)
* Bug: when drawing way, escape ends drawing. Should revert to previous way.
* Mouse icon should indicate when a join is being made (blue nodes might not be visible)
* i18n
* Should remember which background imagery layer you had previously selected
* Background imagery layers should match those of p1
* Dialog for adding custom imagery url
* Draggin a node under the toolbox and then mouseuping doesn't get passed to the map, so you end up with a node "stuck" to the pointer
* onDataComplete fires the first time a map call has returned - but multiple calls might have been made, so really we should count them and only reset dataWorking when it's back to 0 again

== Miscellaneous data model ==

* Remove created_by=* tags from any data touched


== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* Changing style, and then back again, doesn't redraw everything
* Shields
* More line decoration (cliffs etc.), and implied values for 'dashes' if not supplied
* Complete MapCSS support
* 'Light' version without vectorlayer support etc.
* Infinite z-indexes
