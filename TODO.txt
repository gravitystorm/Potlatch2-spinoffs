Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
-----------------------------------

== Core geometry ==

* P1-style J (join)
* Doing a '-' to remove a point from a junction doesn't redraw the point on other ways

== Vector background layers ==

* Pass in via URL parameter
* Load from local file (Flash Player 10 only)
* TagTransform (cf http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/TagTransform)
* Connectivity isn't preserved when bringing ways through (e.g. from OSM layer)
* Alt-click on lines from GPX appears to prevent anything from being selected.
* z-ordering - areas in editing layer prevent background layers from being clicked.

== Tag editing ==

* initialiseEditors is quite slow (typically 150ms)
* Can't use + for second tag
* Tag panel jumps up and down when number spinner is used on bike parking
* New relation panel jumps up and down, but I haven't seen it on editing existing relations
* Changing relation ref doesn't update the main tagviewer until the entity is reselected
* Changing type of relation doesn't update the main tagviewer until the entity is reselected
* Adding a relation via the advanced panel doesn't update the simple panel
* 'Select relation' panel doesn't indicate that the list is being filtered (e.g. simple -> add to a route)
* Checkbox needs a clear button, or to be changed to a ✓✗? triplet


== UI ==

* Failing to parse map_features should be an error state
* Escape should rewind the entity to how it was before the current ControllerState. (Record a position in the undo stack when exiting a ControllerState, and escape would rewind to that)
* Potlatch 1-style "floaty warnings"
* Repeat tags (R) doesn't update the advanced tag panel
* Custom imagery dialog fixes
* Ctrl-clicking two areas (one inside the other) should create a multipolygon
* GPS loading should have a loading... label
* Pressing undo/redo sometimes doesn't change controllerstate. (e.g. create POI + undo leaves the tag panel still referring to POI)
* The standard keyboard shortcut of cmd+z doesn't work for undo, instead it just enters a z.
* In the advanced tag view if you use the back delete key to delete it will delete the first one or two characters and then jump to the end of the text field. (Tested in Mac OS X and Windows) (Build 24127 geowiki.com)
* Draw a new way, assign a road type to it, and then switch to advanced view and note that the tags are not there. (Build 24127 geowiki.com)
* If you get a map error (e.g. too many nodes in bbox) you don't get a helpful dialog

== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* halcyon_viewer needs updating for new tileurl stuff
* Shields
* More line decoration (cliffs etc.), and implied values for 'dashes' if not supplied
* MapCSS 0.2 support - see http://osm.kosmosnimki.ru/?zoom=13&lat=53.89722&lon=27.58215&layers=B00 and http://code.google.com/p/kothic/source/browse/src/styles/osmosnimki-maps.mapcss
* .gz support for OSMConnection
* Multipolygon rendering for dashedLine, lineDecoration, and WayBitmapFiller
* Multipolygons should take their tags from the relation, not the way

== MyGPX ==

* Have a remove button for removing loaded traces
* Have a check button for simplifying traces
* Figure out how to call P2/Simplify for halcyon-based code
* When a GPX is loaded, it's not actually drawn until you pan the map


Requested enhancements
----------------------

== Other core ==

* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support
* Support undo / redo across saving events

== Tag editing ==

* Ability to specify that a node should be a point in a way, for example for crossings
* Ability to say that it's unlikely/impossible to have a way that is a bridge and a tunnel at the same time.
* Dynamic reloading of stylesheet/map_features, so that you don't need to reload the full page when editing them
* The area of pois for dragging on to the map should have a search, with synonyms.
* If you have both inputSets names and buildingAddress, and name= key is filled in then the basic tab will get both, surely only name should be shown and building name should be ignored e.g. cafes. [Actually this was an issue of addr: being missing from one of them, however this may still be a problem for other overlapping inputSets]

== UI ==

* Bbox-sensitive menu for background imagery
* CSS editing
* Quick-search on add-relations-to-way dialog (RelationSelectPanel)
* i18n

== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* 'Light' version without vectorlayer support etc.
