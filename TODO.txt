Potlatch 2: main outstanding issues
-----------------------------------

== Core geometry ==

* purgeOutside simply doesn't work - WayUIs stay around. To investigate
* P1-style J (join) / shift-J (unjoin)
* Make parallelise properly undoable

== Vector background layers ==

* Pass in via URL parameter
* Load from local file (Flash Player 10 only)
* TagTransform (cf http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/TagTransform)
* Connectivity isn't preserved when bringing ways through (e.g. from OSM layer)

== Saving ==

* Should be able to reuse changesets

== Tag editing ==

* initialiseEditors is quite slow (typically 150ms)
* Bug where the wrong feature is used, when an item that is dragged from the list when an POI has no icon.

== UI ==

* Escape should rewind the entity to how it was before the current ControllerState. (Record a position in the undo stack when exiting a ControllerState, and escape would rewind to that)
* Potlatch 1-style "floaty warnings"
* Custom imagery dialog fixes
* Ctrl-clicking two areas (one inside the other) should create a multipolygon
* B keypress for background source tag
* Multiple selection
* Options should be remembered via SharedObjects
* small node hitzone when creating areas - hitzone and mouseover UI don't match up
* backspaceNode leaves junctions on other ways highlighted
* Unexpected number of undo actions (3) when undoing drawway after adding a junction
* GPS loading should have a loading... label
* Pressing undo/redo sometimes doesn't change controllerstate. (e.g. create POI + undo leaves the tag panel still referring to POI)

== Miscellaneous data model ==

* Remove created_by=* tags from any data touched

== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* halcyon_viewer needs updating for new tileurl stuff
* Shields
* More line decoration (cliffs etc.), and implied values for 'dashes' if not supplied
* MapCSS 0.2 support
* .gz support for OSMConnection
* Multipolygon rendering for dashedLine, lineDecoration, and WayBitmapFiller
* Multipolygons should take their tags from the relation, not the way




Requested enhancements
----------------------

== Other core ==

* Non-900913 projections
* Plugin support
* Support undo / redo across saving events

== Tag editing ==

* Ability to specify that a node should be a point in a way, for example for crossings
* Ability to say that it's unlikely/impossible to have a way that is a bridge and a tunnel at the same time.
* It would be useful to have fields that only allow numbers in a non-destructive way, for example for step_count or capacity.
* Dynamic reloading of stylesheet/map_features, so that you don't need to reload the full page when editing them
* The area of pois for dragging on to the map should have a search, with synonyms.
* If you have both inputSets names and buildingAddress, and name= key is filled in then the basic tab will get both, surely only name should be shown and building name should be ignored e.g. cafes. [Actually this was an issue of addr: being missing from one of them, however this may still be a problem for other overlapping inputSets]

== Turn restrictions ==

* Splitting a way should have smart turn restriction behaviour - i.e. only retain the relation in that part of the way which joins the via point.

== UI ==

* Mouse wheel zooming
* Bbox-sensitive menu for background imagery
* CSS editing
* Quick-search on add-relations-to-way dialog (RelationSelectPanel)
* i18n

== Rendering (Halcyon) ==

* 'Light' version without vectorlayer support etc.
